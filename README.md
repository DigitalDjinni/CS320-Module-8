How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  To ensure that my code is functional and secure I first have to have full understanding of what the end goal is and what the user wants. Once i have this information I can aim to create tests using tools such as JUnit to test and make sure the program is giving desired output.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  To interpret user needs you and the user must be in agreement on what the software requirements are. It is very important to keep a transparent relationship and open communication so that everyone is on the same page and knows what to expect. You can then show your user what 
  progress you have made and see if the changes line up to their vision or if they want to go another route. Early testing and open communication with the user will help make sure there isnt bugs or that your not designing useless software costing the company money and time for nothing
How do I approach designing software?
  The way i approach designing software is simple. First i make sure i understand the requirements, once i know that i fully understand what is being required of me I go ahead and write my pseudocode and then start coding. While coding i stop and test little by little and make sure that
  everything is working as it should and if it is i push my project to git then start working on the next part this way i always have something to go back to if i do wind up messing something in my code up. Now after this class I will start using testing such as JUnit as i see
  the advantages of such tools and how benificial they are.
